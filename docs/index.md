# bipartite

A context layer for research groups: connecting your internal world (projects, repos, coordination) to the external academic world (papers, citations, authors).

- **Go CLI** for querying literature, GitHub activity, and your group's knowledge graph
- **Claude Code skills** for synthesis: narrative digests, check-ins, spawning sessions with context
- **Git-backed storage** — JSONL source of truth, private by default, shareable by design

## Guides
