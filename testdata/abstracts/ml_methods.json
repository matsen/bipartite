  "abstract": "We introduce a novel deep neural network architecture for predicting protein tertiary structure from amino acid sequences. Our model combines attention mechanisms with graph neural networks to capture both local and long-range interactions between residues. Training on a large corpus of experimentally determined structures, the network learns to predict inter-residue distances and dihedral angles with high accuracy. The resulting structure predictions achieve competitive performance on CASP benchmark datasets, demonstrating the power of end-to-end learning for this challenging computational biology problem.",
